During the investigation, it was discovered that the employee\u0026rsquo;s work credentials had been exposed in a recent data breach.\nThe employee had used their work email address to sign up on a third-party platform, which exposed their credentials. Malicious actors exploited these credentials to access the employee\u0026rsquo;s email account and send phishing emails to other employees within the organization.\nYour task is to investigate this incident by analyzing logs, determining the extent of the attack, identifying whether users interacted with the phishing emails, and uncovering the impact of the phishing campaign on the network.\nSetup #\rFor this investigation scenario, we will primarily use Splunk Search to analyze the logs. Additionally, we\u0026rsquo;ll use other tools such as xml.onlineviewer, Cyberchef, and VirusTotal.\nReminders #\rSplunk is an analysis platform that allows you to collect, index, and search data generated by systems, applications, and network devices. It retrieves its logs through various mechanisms such as agents installed on endpoints, log file ingestion, or even APIs.\nOnce collected, the data is indexed, which helps to organize and facilitate the search process. Splunk uses the SPL (Search Processing Language) to query this data.\nInitial Access #\rQuestion 1 #\rWhich email account was compromised and used to launch the attack?\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s check the available \u0026ldquo;sourcetypes\u0026rdquo; on our system:\nindex=\u0026#34;main\u0026#34; | stats count by sourcetype Sourcetypes in Splunk are labels that indicate the type of data or the origin of the collected events.\nTo answer this question, we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on the \u0026ldquo;syslog\u0026rdquo; first. Syslogs gather logs generated by various devices and usually contain detailed information about system and security activities.\nTo speed things up and avoid being flooded with information, we\u0026rsquo;ll search with a regex to only display email addresses:\n* sourcetype=syslog | regex _raw=\u0026#34;[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+\u0026#34; We see a lot of logs, so to make our task easier, we\u0026rsquo;ll count how many times each email address appears and display the results in a table:\n* sourcetype=syslog | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;(?\u0026lt;email\u0026gt;[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+)\u0026#34; | stats count by email | sort -count | head 10 | rename count AS \u0026#34;Number of occurrences\u0026#34;, email AS \u0026#34;Email address\u0026#34; We can even visualize this as a graph:\nAnswer: twhite@infinitechsolutions.xyz\nQuestion 2 #\rAfter identifying the compromised account, the attacker sent phishing emails to other employees in the company. What are the names of these employees, listed in chronological order and separated by commas?\nThe email sending log format is as follows:\nUser [sender_email] [IP_address]; Message [message_ID] for [recipient_email] For the search, we run:\n* sourcetype=syslog \u0026#34;User twhite@infinitechsolutions.xyz\u0026#34; | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;Message \u0026lt;[^\u0026gt;]+\u0026gt; for (?\u0026lt;recipient\u0026gt;[\\w\\.-]+@[\\w\\.-]+\\.\\w+)\u0026#34; | table _time recipient | sort _time | stats list(recipient) as recipients | eval recipients=mvjoin(recipients, \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;) This query allows us to identify and list the recipients in chronological order.\nIndeed, we select the user from the compromised account and use a regex to extract and store the recipient\u0026rsquo;s email address in a variable.\nThen, we sort the results chronologically and format the output for readability.\nAnswer: rnichols,llopez,gbaker,ahall\nQuestion 3 #\rWhat is the name of the malicious attachment sent from the compromised account?\nThis question gave me more trouble than I expected. Initially, I searched:\n* sourcetype=syslog \u0026#34;User twhite@infinitechsolutions.xyz\u0026#34; | regex _raw=\u0026#34;for (rnichols|llopez|gbaker|ahall)@infinitechsolutions\\.xyz\u0026#34; However, there was no trace of any attachment. I then thought, \u0026ldquo;Hmm, I must not be on the right sourcetype; I\u0026rsquo;ll search the others.\u0026rdquo;\nSo I searched:\nindex=* \u0026#34;twhite@infinitechsolutions.xyz\u0026#34; | stats count by sourcetype Only syslog is available, so I\u0026rsquo;m on the right sourcetype. I then continued to think and decided, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll bypass the formatting issue and simply search for file extensions.\u0026rdquo;\nI asked ChatGPT for a list of extensions and ended up with this query:\nindex=* sourcetype=syslog twhite@infinitechsolutions.xyz | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;attachment=(?\u0026lt;malicious_attachment\u0026gt;[\\w\\.-]+\\.(exe|zip|pdf|docx|xlsm|js|vbs|scr|bat))\u0026#34; | table _time malicious_attachment | sort _time Still nothing, no attachment was found.\nSince I was still stuck, I decided to think differently. The lab title is \u0026ldquo;Midnight RDP\u0026rdquo;, which reminded me of the APT known as \u0026ldquo;Midnight Blizzard\u0026rdquo;.\nDuring my research, I came across an article titled \u0026ldquo;How Midnight Blizzard Uses Malicious .RDP Files to Exploit Windows Systems: A Technical Guide\u0026rdquo; (by Yua Mikanana).\nWell, given the lab title, it was obvious. So I searched for \u0026ldquo;.RDP\u0026rdquo; and obtained the file:\nAnswer: cloud zerotrust compliance.rdp\nExecution #\rQuestion 1 #\rAfter analyzing user interactions, which employee downloaded and executed the malicious attachment?\nWe change the sourcetype, moving over to WinEventLog.\nWinEventLog corresponds to Windows event logs, which record various system activities (like errors, warnings, security information, or application events) to allow tracking and analysis of events on a Windows system.\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; cloud zerotrust compliance.rdp Here, we can clearly see the username of the user who downloaded the file: C:\\Users\\rnichols\\Downloads\\cloud zerotrust compliance.rdp\nAnswer: rnichols\nQuestion 2 #\rOn the DC machine, a DLL tag was executed by the attacker in memory. What are the first 10 bytes of the SHA-256 hash of this malicious DLL file?\nFirst, let’s list the DLLs related to PowerShell on the DC:\nindex=* sourcetype=xmlwineventlog \u0026#34;Powershell\u0026#34; | search host=\u0026#34;DC01\u0026#34; | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;(?\u0026lt;file\u0026gt;\\b\\w{6,8}\\.\\w{3}\\b)\u0026#34; | search file=\u0026#34;*dll\u0026#34; We notice that the complete script is too long to be recorded in a single event. It is therefore split into segments. This can be observed thanks to the MessageNumber:\nThe two events share the same ActivityID {0B39225B-3C43-0001-5078-390B433CDB01} as well as other identifiers, indicating that they belong to the same script execution.\nThe first segment (MessageNumber = 1) contains the beginning of the script, including the configuration of the PowerShell environment and the definition of functions such as func_get_proc_address and func_get_delegate_type.\nThe last segment (MessageNumber = 33) contains the end of the script, notably the part that decodes a Base64 string (XOR’d with the key 35) and allocates memory to execute the decoded code.\nTogether, these segments reassemble the entire payload which is likely intended to inject and execute code in memory.\nOnce reassembled, the script decodes an obfuscated payload (first Base64, then XOR’d with 35) and uses native Windows functions (like VirtualAlloc via GetProcAddress and GetDelegateForFunctionPointer) to allocate memory and execute the malicious code.\n[...] $var [...] -bxor 35 [...] We can reassemble it using a Splunk search:\nindex=* sourcetype=xmlwineventlog EventID=4104 0B39225B-3C43-0001-5078-390B433CDB01 | stats values(ScriptBlockText) as Script by SystemTime | table Script We can then decode the script using Cyberchef:\nWe find our DLL in question:\nFinally, we extract the file and retrieve its hash:\nAnswer: 0ee6bc20a7f855d881cce962de09c77960ea5c85ca013e3d123fce61109ff8c5\nPersistence #\rQuestion 1 #\rAfter the malicious connection was established, a file was dropped on the system. What is the name of this dropped file?\nWe know that the .rdp file was executed around 20:45:27 (see Question 1 from the Execution section).\nSo, we\u0026rsquo;ll start our search from that moment.\nFirst, I tried searching in Splunk for downloads using PowerShell commands (Invoke-WebRequest, curl, etc.), but that didn’t yield anything.\nI then modified my search:\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; \u0026#34;rnichols\u0026#34; | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;CommandLine=(?\u0026lt;CommandLine\u0026gt;.*)\u0026#34; | fillnull value=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | search NOT CommandLine=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/EventData\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/Event\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | stats values(CommandLine) as CommandLine by _time, ParentCommandLine | sort — _time So why does this work?\nHere are the event details:\nThe field TerminalSessionId=3 strongly suggests that the user was connected via an RDP session, because:\nSession 0 is often used by SYSTEM. Local interactive sessions usually start at 1. RDP sessions often have higher IDs (such as 2, 3, etc.). explorer.exe is the main process of the Windows graphical interface and acts as a launcher for programs started by an interactive user.\nPossible scenarios explaining this behavior:\nInteractive session (RDP or not):\nIf rnichols connected via RDP, explorer.exe was launched as the user shell and executed the programs defined in Startup (ztssvc.exe). This situation can also occur even without RDP if the user logs in physically or through a service like runas. Automatic execution at user login:\nSince ztssvc.exe is in Startup, it is executed as soon as the user logs in (whether locally or via RDP). Injection or Persistence via explorer.exe:\nIf an attacker persisted malware via Startup, explorer.exe will automatically run that binary when a user logs in. Exploit or forced execution by an attacker:\nIf explorer.exe was compromised (for example, through DLL injection or another technique), it could have been used to execute ztssvc.exe. Answer: ztssvc.exe\nQuestion 2 #\rTo maintain long-term access, the attacker created a scheduled task on the compromised machine. What is the name of this task?\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; EventCode=4698 OR EventCode=4702 | search user=\u0026#34;rnichols\u0026#34; | table _time EventCode TaskName Command User | rename EventCode as \u0026#34;Event ID\u0026#34;, TaskName as \u0026#34;Scheduled Task\u0026#34;, Command as \u0026#34;Executed Command\u0026#34; | sort _time Question 3 #\rAs part of their persistence strategy, the attacker created a new user account. What is the name of this unauthorized account?\nUsing the same query as in Question 1:\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; \u0026#34;rnichols\u0026#34; | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;CommandLine=(?\u0026lt;CommandLine\u0026gt;.*)\u0026#34; | fillnull value=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | search NOT CommandLine=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/EventData\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/Event\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | stats values(CommandLine) as CommandLine by _time, ParentCommandLine | sort — _time Within the results, you can find an encoded PowerShell command that looks very suspicious:\nWe take this command and decode it using Cyberchef:\nAnswer: Administrator\nQuestion 4 #\rTo facilitate remote access, the attacker modified the remote desktop settings. What is the name of the registry key that determines whether RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections are allowed?\nHaving already investigated and administered quite a few Windows systems, I already knew the answer. Nevertheless, here’s how to find it:\nWe always search for PowerShell commands with -EncodedCommand, as the attacker executed several:\nWithin these, you can see this command:\nAnswer: fDenyTSConnections\nQuestion 5 #\rFurther investigation revealed the creation of a new user account on the DC. What is the name of this account?\nWe can assume that this was done in the same way as on the other host. So we search with:\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; host=\u0026#34;DC01\u0026#34; \u0026#34;-EncodedCommand\u0026#34; Answer: rniclos\nPrivilege Escalation #\rQuestion 1 #\rWhen examining the privilege escalation technique, what are the last 6 bytes of the CLSID of the privileged COM interface that the attacker exploited?\nThe CLSID is a globally unique identifier (GUID) used by Windows COM (Component Object Model) to identify COM objects in the registry.\nAttackers use CLSIDs of privileged COM interfaces to execute code with elevated privileges:\nThey exploit misconfigured COM objects to escalate their privileges. An attacker can create, manipulate, or call a privileged COM interface* via regsvr32.exe, powershell, mshta.exe, or rundll32.exe. Here, we know that the malware is ztssvc.exe. So we search for all EventCode \u0026ldquo;1\u0026rdquo; (process creation) events related to the execution of ztssvc.exe and filter only those with an IntegrityLevel of \u0026ldquo;High\u0026rdquo;:\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; EventCode=1 | search Image=\u0026#34;*ztssvc.exe*\u0026#34; | search IntegrityLevel=\u0026#34;High\u0026#34; | table _time User CommandLine IntegrityLevel ParentCommandLine | sort _time Answer: 7CE93B6DC937\nQuestion 2 #\rTo elevate their privileges, the attacker dropped another file on the system. What is the name of this file?\nWe run the same command and review everything that happened after the download of the first file (ztssvc.exe):\nindex=* sourcetype=\u0026#34;xmlwineventlog\u0026#34; \u0026#34;rnichols\u0026#34; | rex field=_raw \u0026#34;CommandLine=(?\u0026lt;CommandLine\u0026gt;.*)\u0026#34; | fillnull value=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | search NOT CommandLine=\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/Data\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/EventData\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/Event\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | search NOT ParentCommandLine=\u0026#34;\u0026#34; | stats values(CommandLine) as CommandLine by _time, ParentCommandLine | sort — _time Answer: Akagi64.exe\nDefense Evasion #\rQuestion 1 #\rThe attacker attempted to modify the system behavior to weaken security settings.

This provides a significant amount of room for analysis, as the /data directory contains a wealth of information, such as:\nCheatsheet SANS FOR585\rForeword #\rBefore we begin, here is some important information about Android:\nUser data on Android can be stored both internally and externally. Internal data is saved in NAND flash memory, a non-volatile memory that retains data even when the power is off. NAND stores the bootloader, the operating system, and user data. Application data is stored on NAND flash memory or on the SD card.\nAndroid is based on variants of the Long-Term Support (LTS) branches of the Linux Kernel. With Android v8 (Oreo), Google required the use of Linux Kernel version 4.4 or higher. For example, Android v9 (Pie) runs on versions 4.4, 4.9, or 4.14, depending on the device. More information is available on the Android OS wiki: https://source.android.com/docs/core/architecture/kernel/android-common?hl=en.\nandroid-mainline is the primary development branch for Android features. The mainline Linux branch is merged with android-mainline every time Linus Torvalds releases a version or release candidate:\nCommonly found file systems include:\nEXT4 F2FS YAFFS2 exFAT Most artifacts are stored as SQLite databases and XML files. Android isolates applications at the kernel level, assigning each one a unique identifier (UID) to track running applications.\nAndroid Architecture #\rThe Linux kernel forms the foundation of Android, supporting essential features like threads and low-level memory management used by Android Runtime (ART).\nThe Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides standardized interfaces that expose hardware functionality to higher-level Java APIs. It consists of library modules specific to each hardware component (such as the camera or Bluetooth). When an API accesses hardware, Android loads the corresponding library module.\nThe Android Runtime (ART) environment runs each application in its own process and instance. ART manages multiple virtual machines on low-memory devices, using DEX bytecode specially designed and optimized for Android. Compilation tools like d8 transform Java code into DEX bytecode for execution on Android.\nMany essential Android system components and services, such as ART and HAL, are created from native code requiring native libraries written in C and C++.\nAndroid\u0026rsquo;s features are accessible via Java APIs, facilitating the reuse of key modular system components and services like notifications, resource management, and localization.\nSystem applications are the core set of apps that come with Android.\nAndroid Virtual Machine #\rVirtual Machines (VMs) act as abstraction layers between an application and the underlying Android device.\nEach application runs in its own instance within a VM, isolating it from other applications.\nAndroid applications are written in Java but are compiled into Java bytecode.\nThis bytecode is then transformed into Dalvik bytecode (.dex files) or ART bytecode.\nDalvik and ART run the bytecode (.dex) in a virtual machine, allowing applications to function independently of the underlying hardware.\nBefore KitKat (v.4.4), Android used Dalvik VMs.\nStarting with Lollipop (v5.0), Android began using Android Runtime (ART) and phased out Dalvik VM.\nBoth Dalvik and ART use DEX bytecode, but ART includes new optimization features.\nDirectory Structure #\r/cache: Can contain Gmail attachments, downloads, browsing data, and OTA updates. /efs: Contains files necessary for device operation in case of failure. /data: /data/data: Contains application folders (/data/data/com.example.app), app configuration files, SQLite databases, logs, cache, etc. /app: Stores .apk files from the Android market. *Malware may be found here. /backup: Stores backup APIs for developers; user backup data is not stored here. /media: Internal storage equivalent to an SD card. *Malware may be found here. /misc: Stores files related to Bluetooth, DHCP, VPN, Wi-Fi, etc. /system: Contains key files such as gesture.key and passwords.key; the accounts.db file, which stores usernames and passwords for file authentication, etc. /property: Stores system properties, including timezone, language settings, etc. /mnt: /asec: Stores unencrypted app data. /DCIM: Stores album thumbnails. /Pictures: Stores camera images. /downloads: Locally downloaded files. /secure/asec: Stores encrypted app data. /system: /app: Contains .apk files. *Malware may be found here. /priv-app: Contains .apk files with system-level permissions. *Malware may be found here.

Setting it up may take some time, so I’m starting with it here.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re unfamiliar with Autopsy, here’s a brief description:\nAutopsy is an open-source digital investigation tool. It serves as the graphical interface for the Sleuth Kit and other forensic tools. It is commonly used to analyze hard drives and smartphones in the context of investigations. Key features of Autopsy include deleted file recovery, metadata analysis, keyword searching, timeline visualization, file system analysis, and more.\nTo use it, we need to create a \u0026ldquo;Case\u0026rdquo;:\nHere, we know we’re not dealing with a \u0026ldquo;Disk Image\u0026rdquo; or a VM, nor a local disk. Therefore, we select the appropriate option, \u0026ldquo;Logical Files\u0026rdquo;:\nWe wait for Autopsy and its modules to complete the ingestion process. This may take some time.\nAll set, we can begin the investigation:\nQuestions #\rQuestion 1 #\rWhat is the email address used by the agent in various applications/services? To answer this, I will use the report generated by Autopsy via ALEAPP (Android Logs Events And Protobuf Parser), an open-source project aimed at parsing all known Android artifacts for forensic analysis.\nTo find it quickly and easily, we can search in:\n/data/data/com.android.vending/databases/library.db to find the Google account used to download apps. /data/data/com.android.providers.contacts/databases/contacts2.db to find the Google account used to sync contacts. Additionally (not applicable in this challenge):\n/data/com.android.vending/shared_prefs/lastaccount.xml (last account used on Google PlayStore for Android 9 and later). /data/com.google.android.gms/shared_prefs/BackupAccount.xml (email for backup account). /data/com.android.email/databases/EmailProvider.db (email accounts, 3rd-party app data, and messages associated with email notifications). Finally, we end up with the HTML report:\nThe email address can be found in various places.\nFor example, in the \u0026ldquo;Chrome\u0026rdquo; app under \u0026ldquo;Autofill\u0026rdquo; (a feature that automatically fills in forms with saved information):\nIn the Chrome \u0026ldquo;Login Data\u0026rdquo;:\nAnd in the \u0026ldquo;Installed Apps (Library)\u0026rdquo; section, we find the Google account email used for app downloads:\nAnswer: olegpachinksy@gmail.com\nQuestion 2 #\rWhat is the contact number of the handler assigned to the arrested agent?\nIn the \u0026ldquo;Contacts\u0026rdquo; section:\nAnswer: +323145232315\nQuestion 3 #\rRetrieve the credentials and link to the official portal for Ravenski agents. This could provide an intelligence advantage by using this access to gather actionable information about upcoming operations planned by the Ravenski government.\nWe already found the answer to this question in Question 1 via Chrome \u0026ldquo;Login Data\u0026rdquo;:\nAnswer: agent.ravensk.idu.com:olegpachinksy007:HBLKNKD0MADsdfsa2334(*\u0026amp;DSMDB\nQuestion 4 #\rWhat is the contact code used to confirm the identity of the agent and handler when using a secure chat channel?\nFirst, I’ll check for potential SMS messages here: /data/data/com.android.providers.telephony/databases/mmssms.db.\nNothing found.\nWe could also check here, though not applicable in this challenge:\n/data/com.google.android.gms/databases/icing_mmssms.db (SMS/MMS). /data/com.google.android.gms/databases/ipa_mmssms.db (SMS/MMS). We need to find the messaging app used. In Autopsy’s \u0026ldquo;Installed Programs\u0026rdquo; section, we can view all installed apps:\nDifferent categories are shown:\nInstalled Apps (GMS) Installed Apps (Library) Installed Apps (Vending) Installed Apps - GMS: This category refers to apps installed on the device, regardless of their installation method. Data can be found here: /data/com.google.android.gms/databases/.\nInstalled Apps - Library: This category refers to the app library for the Google user on the device. It may contain apps installed by the same Google account on another device or a previous installation. Data is stored here: /data/com.android.vending/databases/.\nInstalled Apps - Vending: This category specifically refers to apps installed via the Google Play Store. Data is retained even if the app is uninstalled and is located here: /data/com.android.vending/databases/.\nFor clarity, let’s return to ALEAPP and focus on \u0026ldquo;Vending\u0026rdquo; type apps:\nThe app that stands out is mega.privacy.android.app. Indeed, it’s a messaging application:\nALEAPP has parsed messages exchanged via MEGA:\nWe can find this information here: /data/data/mega.privacy.android.app/karere-TU1IaTh4TUJpdTQKAfO_2P0qU8NMP7zDRlgv.db.\nAnswer: REDAPPLEONACAR\nQuestion 5 #\rThe handler shared a document with the agent using a cloud storage service. When was this file shared with the agent?\nNothing found in messages. The document must have been sent another way. We know there’s no other messaging app, and it couldn’t have been sent via SMS/MMS.\nIn the installed apps, we saw com.google.android.apps.docs. Let’s check here: \\data\\data\\com.google.android.apps.docs.\nWe find the database /data/data/com.google.android.apps.docs/app_cello/olegpachinksy@gmail.com/cello.db containing this information:\nThe file can also be found here: EVIDENCE-CASE-RAVENSKIAN-AGENT-002/storage/emulated/0/Download/Debrief-Velorian OP Expansion East.pdf:\nNote: Autopsy interprets timestamps using your computer’s time zone by default. Remember to adjust this setting in Autopsy (Tools \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; View \u0026gt; Time Zone).\nAnswer: 2024-04-01 09:36:41\nQuestion 6 #\rWhat is the download URI for the previously identified shared file?\nWe know the file was downloaded, as we found it in /storage/emulated/0/Download/.\nThus, we can search in /data/data/com.android.providers.downloads/databases/downloads.db:\nAnswer: https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v2internal/files/1iQKKlBU2vuJD1Xet6IYPt7IODVtDHxv1?alt=media\u0026amp;source=downloadUrl\u0026amp;auditContext=fileAction\u0026amp;reason=909\u0026amp;syncType=1\u0026amp;featureLabel=android-sync-classic\u0026amp;openDrive=false\u0026amp;errorRecovery=false\u0026amp;originatorApp=102\nQuestion 7 #\rTo gather further intelligence for Veloria’s counter-espionage efforts, what was the primary objective of this cyber operation led by the Ravenski government?\nReturning to the document:\nAnswer: Infiltrate the Velorian secured network to gather intelligence on upcoming cyber-attacks, their techniques, and target countries.\nQuestion 8 #\rIdentifying the handler is also crucial for Velorian law enforcement to understand the scope of this operation. What is the handler’s email address?\nWe already saw this in the MEGA app messages:\nAnswer: ivoryalex783@gmail.com\nQuestion 9 #\rWhat is the name of the place where the agent and handler met?\nReturning to the messages:\nThis question took the most time; I spent about an hour on it.\nInitially, I searched the usual locations:\n/data/com.google.android.apps.maps/databases/gmm_storage.db /data/com.google.android.apps.maps/databases/search_history.db /data/com.google.android.apps.maps/databases/da_destination_history /data/com.sec.android.daemonapp/db/weatherClock /data/com.google.android.apps.maps/app_tts-cache/ /data/com.google.android.apps.maps/cache/image_manager_disk_cache/ After finding nothing, I thought the answer might be in the metadata of images on the phone. Indeed, there were 48 images, several of which showed bars:\nHowever, nothing conclusive.\nI then questioned:\nAre there other navigation/location apps on the phone? Is it certain I should look in the Google Maps app? No, only Google Maps. No, it’s possible the search was made in the browser instead. After checking typical Google Maps artifacts, I decided to search in the browser but found nothing.\nSo I returned to digging through Google Maps artifacts:\napp: nothing relevant app_offline_downloads: nothing relevant app_offline_hashes: nothing relevant app_textures: nothing relevant app_webview: nothing relevant cache: nothing relevant databases: too many files, will revisit files: \u0026ldquo;new_recent_history_cache_search.cs\u0026rdquo; It turns out I could have simply searched for the keyword \u0026ldquo;Pub\u0026rdquo; 🤡\nAnswer: Levstik Pub\nQuestion 10 #\rAccording to the chat between the agent and handler, it appears that the handler sent the agent an image related to the infrastructure used by the Ravenski government for this cyber-espionage operation. What C2 framework is used by the Ravenski government?\nHaving already reviewed all images for Question 9, I have the answer.\nAnswer: Empire\nQuestion 11 #\rCollecting information on infrastructure, such as IP addresses or hostnames, is crucial for Velorian authorities as they prepare a counter-offensive. Based on the recovered image sent by the handler to the agent, what is the IP address of one of the C2 servers operated by Ravenski threat actors?\nAnswer: 98.24.12.45\n","date":"19 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog-cyber/en/posts/opshieldwall-2/","section":"Posts","summary":"Scenario #\rWe have successfully confirmed the location of the malicious actor who compromised our government’s WiFi network.","title":"OpShieldWall-2","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"19 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog-cyber/en/tags/sherlock/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sherlock","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog-cyber/en/tags/easy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Easy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"7 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog-cyber/en/tags/network-forensic/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Network Forensic","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rScenario #\rThank you for responding to our call. The Ministry of Defense of Velorian is in desperate need of assistance\u0026hellip;\nWe need to keep this discreet, but we believe that the public WiFi at the Ministry of Defense offices in Velorian has been compromised.
